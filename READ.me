Overview
Type: Market Microstructure / Order Flow
Asset(s): BTCUSDT (Crypto)
Timeframe: Tick
Style: Intraday / High-frequency
This strategy exploits short-term price movements in BTC/USDT by monitoring top-of-book quote imbalance on Binance tick data. It generates trade signals when the bid/ask volume skew exceeds a defined threshold and manages trades with a cooldown period to avoid overtrading.

Parameters
Instrument: BTCUSDT (Binance)
Resolution: Tick
Imbalance Threshold: ±0.4
Position Size: 0.02 BTC (~$1,250 at $62K)
Cooldown Period: 5 minutes between trades
Note on Imbalance Calculation:
The imbalance is calculated as (bidSize - askSize) / (bidSize + askSize), resulting in a value between -1 and +1.
A threshold of +0.4 means bids must be ~2.4× larger than offers to trigger a buy signal.
Similarly, -0.4 means offers must be ~2.4× larger than bids to trigger a sell signal.
Strategy Logic
Signal Generation
For each tick quote:
Compute imbalance = (bidSize - askSize) / (bidSize + askSize)
Enter long if imbalance > 0.4
Exit if imbalance < -0.4
Signal ignored if cooldown period hasn’t passed
Risk Management
Only one active position at a time
Position size is fixed (aggressive relative to portfolio size)
Trade frequency controlled via cooldown logic
Exit Logic
Exit position when opposite signal is triggered
Automatically logs and tracks trade activity
